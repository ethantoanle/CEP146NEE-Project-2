AI can be really useful, but there are some challenges and risks we need to keep in mind.
First, there’s the issue of data privacy. AI systems often use personal information, especially in healthcare and education, which creates a risk of data being exposed or misused.

Next is bias in algorithms. If the data used to train an AI system is biased, the AI can make unfair decisions — for example, rejecting someone for a loan or misjudging a student’s performance.

Another challenge is over-reliance on technology. When people depend too much on AI, they may stop double-checking results or lose important skills.

And finally, in schools, teacher training and readiness is a big concern. Teachers need proper support and training to use AI tools effectively, otherwise the technology won’t be used the right way.
