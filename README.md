1. Introduction (15–20 seconds) - Ethan

AI in education refers to the use of intelligent technologies—like chatbots, adaptive learning systems, and automated assessment—to support teaching and learning. It matters today because classrooms are becoming more digital, student needs are more diverse, and educators face heavier workloads than ever. A recent study found that over 60% of students already use AI tools for learning, showing just how rapidly adoption is growing.

2. Key Areas of AI Adoption in Education (60 seconds) - Lance
- Pick 2–3 areas to keep it concise. For example:
- a. Personalized Learning
- Adaptive learning platforms
- Tailored content and pacing
- b. Administrative Automation
- Grading automation
- Scheduling, admissions screening
- Reducing teacher workload
- c. Intelligent Tutoring Systems
AI tutors
- 24/7 support for students
  
3. Benefits of AI in Education (30–40 seconds) - Komil
- Improved learning outcomes
- More inclusive learning (accessibility tools)
- Efficiency for teachers and institutions

4. Challenges & Risks (30–40 seconds) - Ihab
AI can be really useful, but there are some challenges and risks we need to keep in mind.
First, there’s the issue of data privacy. AI systems often use personal information, especially in healthcare and education, which creates a risk of data being exposed or misused.

Next is bias in algorithms. If the data used to train an AI system is biased, the AI can make unfair decisions — for example, rejecting someone for a loan or misjudging a student’s performance.

Another challenge is over-reliance on technology. When people depend too much on AI, they may stop double-checking results or lose important skills.

And finally, in schools, teacher training and readiness is a big concern. Teachers need proper support and training to use AI tools effectively, otherwise the technology won’t be used the right way.

5. Case Examples (20–30 seconds) - Ethan
We’re already seeing powerful real-world examples. Duolingo uses AI to personalize language lessons and even generate practice conversations in real time. Khan Academy’s Khanmigo acts like an AI tutor, guiding students step-by-step while keeping learning safe and structured. And in universities, AI proctoring tools help monitor online exams by detecting unusual behavior and ensuring academic integrity.

6. Conclusion (10–15 seconds) - Ali
- AI is transforming education
- Balance innovation with responsibility
- The future: AI supporting—not replacing—teachers
