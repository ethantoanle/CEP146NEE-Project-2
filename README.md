TOPIC: AI adoption in education

1. Introduction (15–20 seconds) - Ethan

AI in education refers to the use of intelligent technologies—like chatbots, adaptive learning systems, and automated assessment—to support teaching and learning. It matters today because classrooms are becoming more digital, student needs are more diverse, and educators face heavier workloads than ever. A recent study found that over 60% of students already use AI tools for learning, showing just how rapidly adoption is growing.
